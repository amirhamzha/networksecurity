# ## -e . helps to trigger setup.py file and creates packages

# In a requirements.txt file, -e . stands for editable installation of the current project (where . refers to the current directory).

# Key Points:
# Editable Mode (-e):

# Installs the package in development mode.
# Any changes made to the code are reflected immediately, without needing to reinstall the package.
# . (Current Directory):

# Refers to the current project directory containing the setup.py or pyproject.toml file.
# Use Case:

# Commonly used during development to test and debug a project without reinstalling it after every change.
# Example Workflow:
# With -e ., the project can be installed using:
# pip install -r requirements.txt
# Changes to the source code (.py files) will take effect without reinstallation.
